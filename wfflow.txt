Wall Following flowchart
We have 2 distance sensors 
So one on the front, one on the right
if (wall on the right but no wall on the front){
	if (distance to right wall is decreasing> threshold){
		turn left a little
	}
	if (distance to right wall is increasing> threshold){
		turn right a little
	}
}
if(no wall on right){
	turn right 90 degrees
}
if(wall on the right and front){
	turn left 90 degrees
}
